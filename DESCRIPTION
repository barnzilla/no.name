Description: This R package enables users to build
    box/compartment models via an Excel workbook. ODE (ordinary
    differential equation) or CTMC (continuous-time Markov chain) models
    can be built with either single (ODE, CTMC) or multiple age groups
    (ODE). This package also provides tools for users to perform
    sensitivity analsyes/parameter sweeps on their models and to visualize
    model results.
